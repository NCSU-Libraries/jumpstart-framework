title: "Planning a Jumpstart Program"

## Introduction ## 

The [Library Technology Career Jumpstart Program ](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/jumpstart) is a new initiative from NC State University Libraries that has began in 2020. The program is a free, immersive, week-long experience that helps to position first-year library school students for a career in library technology upon graduation.

Jumpstart participants can expect to...

- complete technical workshops
- add to their technical portfolios
- glimpse “a day in the life” of tech librarians
- learn how to apply and interview for technical positions in libraries
- develop an ongoing relationship with a mentor

Response to the first iteration of the program was positive overall. As one 2020 participant noted: 

> “The workshops provided enough direction for me to identify possible interests in lib tech and explore things further on my own. I also really value the mentorship and getting to know the librarians at State. I plan on staying connected with them as I build toward a career in lib tech. There is a huge need for exactly what Jumpstart is offering so I would definitely recommend this program to other LIS students and am really excited to see the program hopefully continue in future years and expand. ”

Response to the 2021 offering of the program was also encouraging, with one participant stating: 

> "The Jumpstart Program exceeded my expectations. I expected to learn something about GitHub, Python, HTML, etc. But I also gained a lot of confidence through this program from the hands-on learning and working through problems with troubleshooters. Hearing from professionals in the field and how they got to where they are today gave me insight into how I can gain experience and learn the skills I need to start a career in this line of librarianship."
