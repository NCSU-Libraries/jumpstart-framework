<p>Our assessment measures included a pre-program knowledge &amp; attitudes survey, a post-program knowledge &amp; attitudes survey, a post-program general feedback survey and a six month follow up video interview.</p>
<div id="determining-goals-and-desired-outcomes" class="section level2">

<p>Due to the nature of this survey and its involvement of human subjects, we sought IRB approval from our institution, which involved drafting a formal informed consent document, ensuring our data would be de-identified, and using our institutional Qualtrics account to instantiate our surveys.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="soliciting-participation-and-feedback" class="section level2">
<h2>Soliciting participation and feedback</h2>
<p>With such a small sample size given our cohort of 8 participants in 2020 and 9 in 2021, we were aiming for as high a rate of participation as possible. To accomplish this, we began recruiting participants to the study early on, sending the pre-program knowledge &amp; attitudes survey out shortly after our tech &amp; accommodations survey. We followed up this initial outreach with several reminder messages and also gave participants time to complete the survey during the first session of the program. In all of our communications, we emphasized the voluntary nature of the study while noting that participation would be beneficial to us in helping to better design future iterations of the program. We left the survey open for two weeks after the completion of the program to allow for optimal participation.</p>
<ul>
<li>We were able to garner %50 participation in the pre-to-post knowledge &amp; attitudes survey for 2020 and had 7 of 8 complete the general satisfaction survey. The six month post-program follow-up video interviews were completed by 3 participants.</li>
<li>As of this writing (Sep. 7, 2021), we are on track for a slightly higher participation rate of 66% for 2021, for the pre-to-post knowledge &amp; attitudes survey, though only 6 of 9 have completed our general satisfaction survey. The six month post-program follow-up interviews for this cohort will be completed in February of 2022.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="interpreting-the-results" class="section level2">
<h2>Interpreting the results</h2>
<p>In interpreting our results, we were able to directly compare participant responses to questions that appeared on both the pre- and post- knowledge and attitudes surveys, such as “I am confident in my ability to learn technical skills.” and “I am likely to pursue a career in library technology.” We were looking to see if there was an overall improvement in responses from pre- to post- (participants moving from ‘somewhat disagree’ to ‘agree’, for example), or even perhaps a regression.</p>
<p>In terms of questions that were unique to the pre- and post- surveys, we conducted hypothesis testing to check our assumptions. We would expect, for example, that someone who answered “disagree” or “strongly disagree” to the pre-program survey question: “I am aware of my options for careers in library technology.” would answer somewhere in the range of “agree” to “strongly agree” to the post-survey question “I learned a lot about technical careers in libraries.” if they also moved to “agree” or “strongly agree” on the former. If not, we would have to reckon with and extrapolate an explanation for such a discrepancy.</p>
<p>For our 2020 cohort, we found…</p>
<ul>
<li>For the <strong>general satisfaction survey</strong>, a notable data point is that all 7 participants who completed the post-program satisfaction survey strongly agreed with this statement: “I am likely to recommend the Jumpstart Program to other LIS/IS students.” Furthermore, we received affirming feedback on things participants thought we did well – such as demystifying library technology careers. We also received helpful constructive feedback on things participants thought we could improve upon – such as providing more pre-work and contextualization, improving the troubleshooting process, and providing more opportunities for cohort building.<br />
</li>
<li>For the <strong>pre-to-post knowledge &amp; attitude surveys</strong>, a technical glitch with Qualtrics meant that participants weren’t able to answer all of our post-survey items, but for those that they did answer, we mostly saw at least one degree of improvement across all of these questions for participants who completed both surveys. If their responses did not improve by at least one degree, they remained the same – meaning that we saw no regressions for any of the survey items. Additionally, all participants strongly agreed with the statement: “The Jumpstart Program felt like a valuable use of my time.”<br />
</li>
<li>Our <strong>6 month follow up interviews</strong> revealed that the Jumpstart Program both confirmed for participants that they were on the right track and introduced them to career opportunities in library technology they hadn’t considered before. It also did seem to have some impacts on the types of courses participants took and internships they considered, and the confidence with which they approached them.</li>
</ul>
<p>For our 2021 cohort, we found…</p>
<ul>
<li>Our <strong>general satisfaction survey</strong> revealed by and large positive sentiment towards the program. All participants, for example, once again strongly agreed that they would recommend the program to other LIS students. They reported that some of the most helpful aspects were the level of individualized attention in addition to getting to hear from real technical librarians about the projects that they work on. Several participants specifically noted that they found the breakout room troublehooting process to be very helpful, while at least one participant was still frustrated by it.</li>
<li>We luckily did not experience any technical glitches with Qualtrics this time around and were able to collect all of the necessary data. In examining our <strong>pre-to-post knowledge &amp; attitude surveys</strong>, we saw that by and large participants improved across all metrics. There were, however, some interesting ‘regressions’. One participant, for instance, moved from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘agree’ on the survey item: “I am confident in my ability to learn the technical skills that I need to know”. Even so, this same participant also moved from ‘neither agree or disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’ on “I am likely to pursue a career in library technology” AND they answered that almost all of the content presented in the program was new for them. Similarly, another participant moved from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘agree’ on “I think of myself as the type of person who would do well in library technology.” BUT they also moved from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” for “I know what technical skills I need to learn to be successful as a librarian.” AND they answered that most of the content was new for them as well. In explaining these regressions, we point to the Dunning-Kruger effect, reasoning that perhaps some participants came in slightly over confident in their own abilities and left with a much more realistic notion of what it will take to be successful as a technical librarian. As such, we count this as a success rather than a failure given that all participants either still agree or strongly agree that they are likely to pursue a career in library technology post-program.<br />

<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Spend concentrated time early in the planning process determining what metrics of success you will measure your program by and design your data collection tools accordingly, seeking IRB approval if needed.</p>
