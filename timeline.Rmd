## Our Timeline ##

The process for planning the first iteration of the Jumpstart Program spanned the entirety of a year. Stretching the planning process out over this amount of time meant that we never felt rushed and that we had the flexibility to adapt to unforeseen circumstances (in this case: COVID-19). Planning for future iterations of this program would likely be condensed into a much shorter time frame given the foundations we laid in the first.

> Tip: Start planning early to accommodate unforeseen roadblocks, especially the first time you host a program like this.
