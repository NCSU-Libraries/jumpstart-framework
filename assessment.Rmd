title: 'Step 7: Assessment'
---

Our assessment measures included a pre-program knowledge & attitudes survey, a post-program knowledge & attitudes survey, a post-program general feedback survey and a six month follow up video interview. 

## Determining goals and desired outcomes ##
Before designing our surveys, we spent some time reviewing our program’s guiding principles and objectives. What did we want participants to walk away with? What learning outcomes were we aiming to achieve? 

### Building appropriate tools ###
Based on this review, we generated the following survey questions: 

#### Pre-Program Knowledge & Attitudes Survey ####

Due to the nature of this survey and its involvement of human subjects, we sought IRB approval from our institution, which involved drafting a formal informed consent document, ensuring our data would be de-identified, and using our institutional Qualtrics account to instantiate our surveys.

## Soliciting participation and feedback ##
With such a small sample size given our cohort of 8 participants, we were aiming for as high a rate of participation as possible. To accomplish this, we began recruiting participants to the study early on, sending the pre-program knowledge & attitudes survey out shortly after our tech & accommodations survey. We followed up this initial outreach with several reminder messages and also gave participants time to complete the survey during the first session of the program. In all of our communications, we emphasized the voluntary nature of the study while noting that participation would be beneficial to us in helping to better design future iterations of the program. We left the survey open for two weeks after the completion of the program to allow for optimal participation. We were able to garner %50 participation in the pre-to-post knowledge & attitudes survey, and had 7 of 8 complete the general satisfaction survey. The six month post-program follow-up video interviews are still as of yet forthcoming. 

## Interpreting the results ##
In interpreting our results, we were able to directly compare participant responses to questions that appeared on both the pre- and post- knowledge and attitudes surveys, such as “I am confident in my ability to learn technical skills.” and “I am likely to pursue a career in library technology.” We were looking to see if there was an overall improvement in responses from pre- to post- (participants moving from ‘somewhat disagree’ to ‘agree’, for example), or even perhaps a regression. Upon review, we found at least one degree of improvement across all of these questions for participants who completed both surveys. 

In terms of questions that were unique to the pre- and post- surveys, we conducted hypothesis testing to check our assumptions. We would expect, for example, that someone who answered “disagree” or “strongly disagree” to the pre-program survey question: “I am aware of my options for careers in library technology.” would answer somewhere in the range of “agree” to “strongly agree” to the post-survey question “I learned a lot about technical careers in libraries.” if they also moved to “agree” or “strongly agree” on the former. If not, we would have to reckon with and extrapolate an explanation for such a discrepancy. 

The general satisfaction survey served more for our own edification in how to improve program delivery in the future, with a notable data point being that all 7 participants who completed the post-program satisfaction survey strongly agreed with this statement: “I am likely to recommend the Jumpstart Program to other LIS/IS students.”

Having not yet reached the six-month follow up interviews, it is our hope that these will prove helpful in determining any potential long-lasting impacts the Jumpstart Program had on participants. 

A more complete analysis is forthcoming as part of our contributed paper to the ACRL 2021 conference. 

> Tip: Spend concentrated time early in the planning process determining what metrics of success you will measure your program by and design your data collection tools accordingly, seeking IRB approval if needed.
